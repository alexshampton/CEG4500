## Implementation Method
The realistic scene I created is a game where you collect coins with a box. I created 3 distinct 3D pieces: a coin, a box, and a traffic cone. The box and coin use 1 polyhedron each, while the cone uses 2 polyhedra, which brings the total to 4 polyhedra. The user can interact with the box using the controls to move the box either left or right. The coin also rotates around it's y axis. There are 2 light in the scene, a point light and a directional light. The box and the cone both use textures from flickr that I had uploaded. The scene is displayed using perspective projection.

## Game Rules
The user has to get the coins inside of the box by moving the box to where the coin will land. If the coin hits the side of the box, hits the ground, or the traffic cone hits the box, the game will end. If the coin lands inside the box without touching the sides, the score will increase. 

## Controls
* d- Move box right
* a- Move box left

## Winning Conditon
Get to score 10 without catching/hitting a traffic cone with the box and catching all 10 coins without missing any.
