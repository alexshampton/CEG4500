# Project 2: Viewing and Lighting a 3D Interactive Scene

For Project 2 you are required to create an interactive 3D scene with 3D graphics in WebGL.

[Note: A game is not necessary. You are welcome to create a game if you like, as long as all of the requirements discussed are incorporated into the game.]

## Requirements for interactive scene
1) The project must model a realistic scene. Examples of scenes: a dining table with chairs and dinnerware, an office desk with a computer and clutter, a room with furniture. This is a chance for you folks to exhibit your creativity and design ideas, so feel free to explore!
2) The project should have at least 4 polyhedra. Think creatively: you have chairs that can take 6 polyhedra, you have chairs that may take just three. 
3) The project should have at least 3 distinct ‘pieces’. Example: a table and a chair are 2 distinct pieces. The ground plane is not a piece, so having a chair, a table, and the ground does not fulfill this requirement.
4) The user should be able to interact with at least one of your pieces using any number of transformations: rotations, translations, and scaling in a meaningful way. For instance, in a dining table scene, the user should be able to pull out the chair, move it around the scene, and rotate the chair about its center. All the single polyhedron transformations that we covered in class can be applied to more than one shape simultaneously. It is up to you how the user interacts with the scene. The user should be able to interact with an entire piece, unless interacting with just a part of a piece is absolutely necessary for your creative idea, and you have consulted with the instructor on this.
5) There should be at least 2 lights in the scene, at least one of which should create a specular reflection.
6) There should be at least 2 textures. It is up to you how you use them.
7) You must display your scene using a perspective projection.
8) The interaction controls should be intuitive to use and you must have a description of the controls in a README.
9) Provide a README on how you implemented your scene. If you implement a game, describe the scoring system and win condition in the README file.

## Deliverable:
Store all files and folders you use (including your Common/ folder or any folders that contain your Common/ folder) in a single directory called ‘project2/‘, compress into a single .zip file called ‘project2.zip’, and upload to the dropbox.


## Scoring Rubric (out of 25 points)
1) 6 points for creating your scene (realistic, at least 4 polyhedra, at least 3 pieces)
2) 3 points for user interaction.
3) 6 points for lighting the scene.
4) 6 points for texturing the shapes in your scene.
5) 3 points for the perspective projection.
6) 1 points for the README description.
