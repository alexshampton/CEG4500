CEG4500 Lab 2: Animation and Interactions
Name: Alexander Shampton

This lab I drew a white shape with 6 verticies. When loading the html page, the shape will move right until user input (Keys: w (up),a (left), s(left), d (right)). Another user input that can be used is a click on the red canvas, which moves the shape to that location pressed on the canvas and will keep its movement speed and rotation (or no rotation). There are also Increase and decrease buttons where they either increase or decrease the shape's movement speed. There are also StartRotate and StopRotate buttons where the shape either rotates or stops rotating when the button is pressed. The StopRotate button will stop the shape and preserve it rotation position.    

The shape's animations and movement were all computed by manipulating a 3x3 matrix in the javascript file and then updated on the html file for each render. Acceleration was used to move the xAxis coords and yAxis coords depending on which direction the shape was going according to xDir/yDir. xDir would be - if going left and + if going right, else it will be 0. yDir is - if going down and + if going up, else it will be 0. Acceleration is increased when pressing the Increase button and decreased when pressing the Decrease button. These button presses either call increaseAcceleration() or decreaseAcceleration() in the JS file. There is also rotation buttons (StartRotate and StopRotate) which start/stop rotating the shape. These button presses call startRotate() or stopRotate() which updates the keepRunning variable, which tells the shape to keep rotating or not. Theta is increased 0.01 if keepRunning is == 1 (meaning shape is still rotating), which continues to rotate the shape. moveX and moveY are the coordinates after tranformations. All of theses computations were implemented into this matrix: [Math.cos(theta), -Math.sin(theta), 0.0, Math.sin(theta), Math.cos(theta), 0.0, moveX, moveY, 1.0]
