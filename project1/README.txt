## Overview
The game I created is similar to a phone game called flappy bird. The game has 6 polygons: the vertically moving square, a static rectangle (grass), 2 horizontally moving rectangles (pipes), a cloud, and a static circle (sun). All of the shapes are different colors, besides the 2 pipes, which are both a shade of green. 

## Win Condition
The win condition of the game is to reach a score of 10, which score is obtained by getting the moving square between the moving pipes without touching the pipes. 

## User Interaction
The user interaction is done with the vertically moving square, which only moves up when the user presses ```spacebar``` or ```clicks the mouse```.   

## How the Game was Implemented
The game starts by drawing 6 shapes on the canvas. Only the vertically moving square (what the user controls) and the horizontally moving rectangles. The static shapes were drawn in a specific position on the canvas and do not move at all. The implementation of the vertically moving square was done by decreasing the y-coordinates each time the render function is called. The user interacts with this vertically moving square by pressing ```spacebar``` or ```clicking the mouse``` and each time the input is pressed, the y coordinates increase. The vertically moving pipes move initially from right to left and once the pipes hit the end of the canvas they move from left to right, when the rectangles hit the end of the canvas again they move right to left, and this process continues until the game ends. This whole process is done by either decreasing/increasing the x-axis each time the render function is called. The rectangles also are randomly placed on the y-axis (fairly placed) each time the pipe goes off the screen the y-axis values change again. A lot of the coordinates of the moving shapes are tracked in javascript to check if the square hits the pipe, the square hits the grass, and if the square goes through the pipe successfully and increases the user's highscore. The matrices are also updated from these changed coordinates to move the square/pipes.
