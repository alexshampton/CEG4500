# Project 1: Creating a 2D Game
For Project 1, you will create a 2D game as a WebGL application. You are recommended to work on this project in a team of two, however, single-person teams will be accepted as well. If you have a teammate you would like to work with, email me with the teammate cc'ed. If you do not have a teammate and do not want to work in a single-person team, I will assign a teammate to you at random.

1) The Game should have more than 5 2D polygons in the duration of the game.
2) The Game should have more than 3 colors.
3) The Game should have a scoring system and win condition.
4) The player must interact with the game to score using a mouse, a keyboard, or event-driven input, e.g. sliders and buttons.
5) The Game Controls should be intuitive to use and have a description of the controls in a file named README.txt.
6) Provide a description in README.txt on how you implemented the your game.

There are no templates provided for the project. If you have a .js file, please provide your name within the .js file. If you have put all your implementation in a .html file (with no .js files), please put your name in comments in the .html file. Also, include your name in README.txt.
  
Some Examples:
  -Galaga
  -Helicopter
  -Pong

Scoring rubric (out of 20 points):
1) 4 points for polygon creation
2) 4 points for coloring polygons
3) 2 points for the scoring system
4) 2 points for the win condition
5) 4 points for player controls and interaction
6) 4 points for the description on how you implemented the game

Deliverables: Store all files and folders you use (including your Common/ folder or any folders that contain your Common/ folder) in a single directory called ‘project1/‘. Zip ‘project1/‘ into a single .zip file called ‘project1.zip’. Please submit ‘project1.zip’ to Pilot by the due date. If you do not follow these instructions, you stand to lose all points pertaining to running of the code, i.e., all points for parts 1 to 5 in the scoring rubric.
