CEG4500 Lab 1: Creating Three Shapes in 2D
Name: Alexander Shampton

This lab I drew a yellow ellipse using TRIANGLE_FAN, a blue shape using TRIANGLE_FAN, and a green triangle using LINE_LOOP. All of these shapes are displayed on a red canvas. 

Used some code from Model 3 to draw the blue shape and triangle using a single buffer.
